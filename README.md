# SIEM_Project

## Overview
Developed and designed a custom monitoring solution using Splunk to report and alert on suspicious activity from Windows Events and Apache logs. 
Created dashboards with multiple visualizations to provide in-depth analysis of attack signatures.
I used Splunk to design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization. I created custom reports, alerts, dashboards, and add-on apps to protect our mock company. Then I experienced a simulated attack and analyzed the results to determine the effectiveness of my monitoring solutions. I completed the project by showcasing my defensive solution in a class presentation.
I analyzed the mock company’s “regular” historical activity to determine its normal range. I then created an alert threshold outside of this normal range (provide percent if you like) to prevent any false positives.
